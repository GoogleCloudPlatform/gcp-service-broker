# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unresolved]

### Security
 - The broker uses a Pivotal library affected by [CVE-2018-15759](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-15759). Until the library is updated, it's recommended that you not run the service broker on a public network. If you must run it on a public network, make it accessible through a proxy that supports fail2ban.

### Added
 - The ability to enable/disable services based on product lifecycle tags. See [#340](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcp-service-broker/pull/340) for context.
 - Preview support for Firestore.
 - Preview support for Dialogflow.
 - Preview support for Stackdriver Metrics.
 - Namespace support for Datastore.
 - Preview support for Dataflow.
 - Default roles for ML, BigQuery, BigTable, CloudSQL, Pub/Sub, Spanner, and Cloud Storage.
 - `/docs` endpoint that serves docs for your installation.
 - Varcontext now supports casting computed HIL values.
 - New regional and multi-regional Cloud Storage plans.

### Changed
 - Support links for services now point to service-specific pages where possible.
 - Feature flags are now handled through a generic toggles framework. Option labels and descriptions might change slightly in the tile.
 - Service definitions now get field-level validation to check for sanity before being registered.

### Removed
 - The `examples/` directory.

## [4.1.0] - 2018-11-05

- Examples of binding variables to the docs.
- Constraints/validation of the binding variables to the docs.
- New `version` sub-command to show the current version of the binary.
- New `generate` sub-commands to generate the `tile.yml` and `manifest.yml` files.

### Changed
- Role whitelists are now validated through JSON Schema checks.
- The `run-examples` sub-command now evaluates the credentials against the JSON Schema, improving robustness.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where Cloud Datastore service accounts were getting the same name.

## [4.0.0] - 2018-10-01

### Added
- New sub-command `plan-info` to dump plan information to the console.
- New sub-command `client` to execute documentation examples and interact with the broker.

- New sub-command `generate` to generate use, tile forms, and configuration documentation.
- New sub-command `serve` to run the service broker server.
- New sub-command `show` to dump database state.
- The ability to configure the system with YAML, TOML, properties, or JSON configuration files via the `--config` flag in conjunction with using environment variables.
- The ability to customize the database name in the Tile.
- The ability to turn on/off services via environment variable.
- Default plans for Spanner, BigTable, and CloudSQL.
- Whitelists for bindings so only certain "safe" roles can be chosen by end-users.
- Automatic labeling of resources with organization GUID, space GUID, and instance ID to BigQuery, CloudSQL, Spanner, and Cloud Storage.

### Deprecated
- Running the service by executing the main executable. Use the `serve` sub-command instead.

### Changed  
- **Breaking** plan ids are now required and will not be generated if not supplied.
- **Breaking** changed custom plan id field name from `guid` to `id`.
- **Breaking** modified `"features"` plan configuration field name to `"service_properties"`.
- **Breaking** modified structure of all catalog-related environment variables - `plans` is now a sub-field of the Service object,
and Service objects are defined individually by setting environment variables like `GOOGLE_<SERVICE_NAME>`
- You no longer have to specify service information in the manifest.
- **Breaking** The Cloud Storage plan `reduced_availability` was changed to `reduced-availability` to be compliant with the spec and work with Kubernetes.
- Tables are created only if they do not exist on migration, fixing [#194](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcp-service-broker/issues/194).
- The broker now adheres to Open Service Broker API version 2.13.
- Improved ORM migrations and test coverage with SQLite3.
