# Open Service Broker for Google Cloud Platform

This is a service broker built to be used with [Cloud Foundry](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/overview.html) and Kubernetes.
It adheres to the [Open Service Broker API v2.13](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md).

Service brokers provide a consistent way to create resources and accounts that can access those resources across a variety of different services.

It supports the following sub-commands:

 * `client` - A CLI client for the service broker.
 * `config` - Show and merge configuration options together.
 * `generate` - Generate documentation and tiles.
 * `help` - Help about any command.
 * `serve` - Start the service broker.

## Testing

Pull requests are unit-tested with Travis. You can run the same tests Travis does using `go test ./...`.

Integration tests are run on a private [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/) pipeline for all changes to the `master` branch.
You can set up your own pipeline using the sources in the `ci` directory if you like.
